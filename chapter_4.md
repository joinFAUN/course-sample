# Functions and Modules in Python

## What is a Function?

A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions are used to organize code into logical groups, which makes it easier to read and maintain. Functions also make it easier to reuse code in different parts of a program.

## Defining a Function

A function is defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the name of the function, followed by a set of parentheses, followed by a colon, followed by the body of the function. The body of the function is indented by four spaces.

```python
def function_name():
    # body of the function
```

## Calling a Function

A function is called using the name of the function, followed by a set of parentheses, followed by a semicolon, followed by the arguments to the function. The arguments to the function are separated by commas.

```python
function_name(argument1, argument2, argument3)
```

## Returning a Value

A function can return a value using the `return` keyword. The `return` keyword is followed by the value to return.

```python
def function_name():
    # body of the function
    return value
```

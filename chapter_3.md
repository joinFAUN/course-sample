# Data Structures in Python

## What is a Data Structure?

A data structure is a way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently. There are many different types of data structures, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some data structures are better for storing data, while others are better for accessing data.

## Lists

A list is a data structure that stores a collection of items. Lists are ordered, which means that the items in a list are stored in a specific order. Lists are also mutable, which means that the items in a list can be changed.

## Tuples

A tuple is a data structure that stores a collection of items. Tuples are ordered, which means that the items in a tuple are stored in a specific order. Tuples are also immutable, which means that the items in a tuple cannot be changed.

## Sets

A set is a data structure that stores a collection of items. Sets are unordered, which means that the items in a set are not stored in a specific order. Sets are also mutable, which means that the items in a set can be changed.

## Dictionaries

A dictionary is a data structure that stores a collection of items. Dictionaries are unordered, which means that the items in a dictionary are not stored in a specific order. Dictionaries are also mutable, which means that the items in a dictionary can be changed.
